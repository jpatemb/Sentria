"""Repo-wide offline guards for the test suite.

pytest loads this file *by path*, not by import, so it never needs
installing into the project's `.venv`. The root `pyproject.toml` pins
pytest's rootdir (and therefore confcutdir) to this directory, which is
what makes these guards load regardless of where pytest is invoked from.
